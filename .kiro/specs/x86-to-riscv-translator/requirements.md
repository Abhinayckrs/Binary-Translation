# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a translation layer that converts x86 instructions to custom RISC-V instructions within the Unicorn Emulator framework. The system will analyze x86 machine code using Capstone disassembler, map the instructions to equivalent RISC-V operations, and execute them in a Unicorn RISC-V emulation environment. This enables running x86 code on RISC-V architecture through dynamic binary translation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to translate x86 instructions to RISC-V instructions, so that I can run x86 code on RISC-V architecture through emulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN x86 machine code is provided THEN the system SHALL disassemble it using Capstone engine
2. WHEN x86 instructions are disassembled THEN the system SHALL identify the instruction type and operands
3. WHEN instruction mapping is available THEN the system SHALL convert x86 instructions to equivalent RISC-V instructions
4. WHEN RISC-V instructions are generated THEN the system SHALL encode them in proper RISC-V machine code format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute translated RISC-V instructions in Unicorn emulator, so that I can verify the translation correctness and observe execution behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RISC-V instructions are generated THEN the system SHALL initialize a Unicorn RISC-V emulator instance
2. WHEN emulator is initialized THEN the system SHALL load the translated instructions into emulator memory
3. WHEN instructions are loaded THEN the system SHALL execute them step by step in the emulator
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL provide register states and memory contents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle different x86 instruction categories, so that I can translate a comprehensive set of x86 operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN arithmetic instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) are encountered THEN the system SHALL map them to RISC-V arithmetic operations
2. WHEN logical instructions (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) are encountered THEN the system SHALL map them to RISC-V logical operations
3. WHEN data movement instructions (MOV, PUSH, POP) are encountered THEN the system SHALL map them to RISC-V load/store operations
4. WHEN control flow instructions (JMP, CALL, RET) are encountered THEN the system SHALL map them to RISC-V branch operations
5. WHEN unsupported instructions are encountered THEN the system SHALL report translation errors with detailed information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage register mapping between x86 and RISC-V, so that register operations are correctly translated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN x86 general-purpose registers are used THEN the system SHALL map them to RISC-V general-purpose registers
2. WHEN x86 special registers (ESP, EBP) are used THEN the system SHALL map them to appropriate RISC-V registers
3. WHEN register conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL implement register allocation strategies
4. WHEN register mapping is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain mapping tables for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle memory addressing modes, so that memory operations are correctly translated between architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN x86 direct addressing is used THEN the system SHALL convert it to RISC-V direct addressing
2. WHEN x86 indirect addressing is used THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate RISC-V load/store sequences
3. WHEN x86 indexed addressing is used THEN the system SHALL calculate addresses and generate RISC-V equivalents
4. WHEN memory operations exceed RISC-V capabilities THEN the system SHALL generate multiple RISC-V instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate translation correctness, so that I can ensure the translated code produces equivalent results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide comparison between original x86 and translated RISC-V code
2. WHEN execution results are available THEN the system SHALL compare register states between architectures
3. WHEN memory modifications occur THEN the system SHALL verify memory contents match expected values
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL report specific discrepancies with diagnostic information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug translation issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with instruction context
2. WHEN emulation fails THEN the system SHALL provide stack traces and register dumps
3. WHEN unsupported features are encountered THEN the system SHALL log warnings with suggested alternatives
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step translation and execution logs
